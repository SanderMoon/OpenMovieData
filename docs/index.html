OpenMovieData is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive dataset of movies and their associated data. 
The dataset is intended to be used for data analysis and machine learning projects. 
Furthermore, these "raw" datasets will be integrated into a Property Graph Database (Neo4j) to provide a more structured and queryable dataset.
