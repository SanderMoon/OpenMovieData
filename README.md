# OpenMovieData

## Introduction

OpenMovieData is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive dataset of movies and their associated data. The dataset is intended to be used for data analysis and machine learning projects. Furthermore, these "raw" datasets will be integrated into a Neo4j Property Graph Database to provide a more structured and queryable dataset.

Further documentation on the graph, sources and Licenses can be found on the [webpage](https://sandermoon.github.io/OpenMovieData/)
